                <h2>Understanding the Internet</h2>
                <p>
                    The internet is a global network connecting billions of devices worldwide, enabling seamless communication and information sharing.
                </p>
                <h3>What is the Internet?</h3>
                <p>
                    At its core, the internet is a network of interconnected devices, including computers, servers, and smart devices. It allows users to access resources, share data, and communicate across vast distances.
                </p>
                <h3>How Does the Internet Work?</h3>
                <p>
                    The internet operates on a system of protocols like TCP/IP, which standardize data transmission. Data is broken into packets and sent through various networks, guided by devices like routers and switches.
                </p>
                <h3>Key Features:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scalability to connect billions of devices.</li>
                    <li>Decentralized architecture for fault tolerance.</li>
                    <li>Accessibility to a wide range of services like email, websites, and streaming platforms.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2> Internet Routing</h2>
                <p>
                    Internet routing is the backbone of digital communication, ensuring that data packets reach their intended destinations efficiently.
                </p>
                <h3>What is Routing?</h3>
                <p>
                    Routing is the process of determining the best path for data packets to travel across networks. This involves analyzing the destination IP address and choosing optimal routes.
                </p>
                <h3>The Role of Routers</h3>
                <p>
                    Routers are critical devices in networking. They:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analyze and forward data packets to their destinations.</li>
                        <li>Facilitate communication between multiple networks.</li>
                        <li>Improve network efficiency and reliability.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Advanced Routing Protocols</h3>
                <p>
                    Routing relies on protocols to share path information. Key protocols include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):</strong> Manages routing between autonomous systems on the internet, crucial for ISPs.</li>
                        <li><strong>OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):</strong> Finds the shortest path within a single network using link-state information.</li>
                        <li><strong>EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol):</strong> Balances efficiency and reliability within enterprise networks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="answer" id="answer2">
                A router analyzes the destination IP address in a data packet and determines the most efficient path to forward it, ensuring successful delivery.
